1. Create zetteli client
  - sketch out react components
    - addNoteView
      - state: notes
    - addNoteForm
      - form values as state
      - valid/invalid as state.
      - submitted/ready
    - dateField
      - no state
    - textarea
      - no state (for now)
    - tags
      - valid/invalid

  - implement react components
    - maybe use localStorage to save state.
